<p>Growing up I had exposure to two languages, Danish and English, &nbsp;in the household, my dad was born and raised in Denmark and then moved here in the 1990s. Being bilingual has played a significant role in my life and how I view the rest of the world. While mostly everyone in Denmark speaks English fluently, there is something special about knowing the local language and fully immersing yourself in the culture. Denmark is a relatively small country and few speak the language outside of its borders. This desire to be more immersed led me to study abroad in Spring 2020 in Copenhagen, Denmark. My program there was The Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE) which hosts American students and has instruction in English so the credits can transfer back to the US standard as European credits work differently. Studying abroad exposed me to systems and cultures that I was not familiar with having lived in the United States my entire life. Studying abroad made me more open-minded and immersed me in our global society.</p>
<p>The feeling of moving to a new place is one that is both scary and exciting. We were housed in an upcoming area of Copenhagen called Sydhavn (&ldquo;South Harbor&rdquo;). Almost immediately I noticed the differences between American education norms and those there. For example, professors are not addressed by their last names but rather their first names. I took six classes over the course of the study abroad program but the most intriguing one was a class called Contemporary Controversies in International Relations which had a Danish-focused twist. The Danish perspective on world affairs is unique as it is a small country, but it also controls the foreign policy of Greenland. In the course, we went on an excursion to the Danish Parliament where we met with Aaja Chemnitz Larsen who is a Greenlandic politician. We got to discuss with her the future of Greenland&rsquo;s relationship with Denmark which had recently been in the headlines when former President Trump offered to purchase the territory. We learned about the unique connection that Greenland has with Denmark. Greenland is within the Kingdom of Denmark but it has political independence but relies on the Danish Government for its diplomatic and military affairs. Greenland has struggled with development due to its low population and limited economic opportunities, creating a reliance on economic assistance from Denmark. This experience was valuable as I got to learn about the functions of the Danish government, a connection to my Danish heritage. Most European governments use a parliamentary structure, which is different than the Executive and Legislative structure in the United States. The differences between these systems were covered in my POLI 481 Politics and Governments of Europe course where we examined governments in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>This is a midterm from my Contemporary Controversies in International Relations course. We were asked to give European and American perspectives on issues such as Iran and Greenland. The differences in these perspectives were driven by policies that the Trump administration had taken that were at odds with European interests.</p>
<p>Traveling through Europe right before the pandemic was stressful as countries had started to impose restrictions. Italy was the first country to lock down on the continent while the rest of Europe had the optimistic view that the virus was contained. However, before the borders closed and everyone went into lockdown I got to travel around through personal and educational trips. One of the concepts we covered in our class was the idea of the Schengen free-movement area which allows for visa-free travel throughout the EU. This movement area allowed me to easily travel around Europe after entering the EU. One of the trips I went on was to Tallinn, Estonia where I learned about the fall of the Soviet Union and how politics there have been shaped over the years since. Seeing how Estonia has used technology to power its transformation from the Soviet Republic was amazing. Seeing digitally transformative ways of doing something like signing a document with an ID card inspired me to think about how those same technologies will be implemented at home in the future. Sustainability and the environment was an area that also stood out to me. Copenhagen, Denmark has bike lanes and highways that allow commuters to ride around and use public transportation alongside it. This contrasts with a country like the United States which has cheaper gas and limited biking opportunities, prioritizing less environmentalism. It made me more aware of the impact that conservation has in a small coastal country like Denmark. In Amsterdam, there is a particular emphasis on flood control, as the city is made up of landmasses between tranches of water. &nbsp;These and my other trips around Europe such as the Czech Republic, Sweden, and Austria exposed me to different perspectives and issues that I will have to consider in my professional future.</p>

<p>Studying and traveling in Europe has expanded my horizons as to who I am as a person. Being able to connect with my Danish heritage and see how problems have been solved differently has made me think outside of the everyday box. My enhanced knowledge about Europeans and their everyday lives will help me make considerations about the technologies I develop in my professional career. Even with the disruption that COVID-19 caused to my experiences, I am able to see the differences in how countries are resolving their issues. I have recognized that the different ways people live their lives influence their solution and their foreign policy decisions. The concepts from my classes enhanced my travels as I could draw on the historical and present realities in those countries. In the future, I want to learn more about the countries I am traveling to beforehand to be able to appreciate those places more. Studying abroad and taking my political science courses have made me consider more perspectives and consider the other side.&nbsp;</p>
