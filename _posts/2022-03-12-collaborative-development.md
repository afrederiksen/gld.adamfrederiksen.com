<p>In modern-day Software Engineering, we have a development process known as agile development. Agile development is an iterative and incremental process where teams of developers work in sprints to accomplish features by dividing the work and planning out to meet deadlines. Agile development is done through the Scrum framework which requires four steps. Creating a backlog, selecting and performing selected tasks, reviewing the results, and then using those results to adjust for the repetition.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to this concept in my CSCE 247 Software Engineering course where we had to work in groups of four to create a concept for a student housing discovery platform. The issue we were trying to solve was the ability for students and parents (lessees) and property managers (lessors) to match and sign with each other by filtering by room count, price, location, and various amenities. However, this application required tasks to be split up and assigned to members of the group. Someone had to work on the menu, the user login, the searching, etc. By using the scrum principles, we were able to divide the work into two two-week sprints where each member would know their part by using a task tracking application known as a sprint board. On this sprint board you can view which tasks have yet to be done, those in progress, and those that are finished. This helps manage our workflow to decide what needs to be a priority and what is going to be a blockage for our next sprints. If there&rsquo;s a blockage, we can have an all-hands call where we will work to figure it out together and decide the next steps.</p>

<p>This agile-based SCRUM framework is used by most companies in the industry to divide up large projects where there can be several hundred developers working on a single application. While these large projects are typically divided into smaller project teams, you can still have groups where several people from different geographic regions work together. During the Summer of 2021, I worked at Publicis Sapient, an American digital business transformation subsidiary of the French marketing giant Publicis. At Sapient, I was challenged to work with six other interns, two project managers, and several technical leads throughout the company. Most of the internship was conducted virtually with people from different regions, underscoring the need for SCRUM practices to manage such a time-sensitive project. The team I was on worked on a grocery pickup tipping and review platform where users could place an order, pickers could pick the order, and then customers could leave a tip and review their experience. This project also allowed store managers to manage pickers and view sales information in real-time. The ability to build a final project was a result of the collaboration between our mentors and working with my fellow interns of different backgrounds. Working with new technologies to design and build an application of this size elevated what I had learned in the classroom. While we learn concepts in the classroom, we do not have the opportunities to build full-fledged applications that could be used for client work.</p>

<p>This is a screenshot from our application that shows the tipping, rating, and order process flow. Each of these components was developed using SCRUM developed by separating the parts of the development. The contributions were all then merged together to build the application after conducting code reviews.</p>

<p>This was a Corporate Social Responsibility project that I co-captained at Publicis Sapient. The project focused on environmentally friendly tips that were combined with an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unbeleafablecsr/">Instagram account</a>. I led the technical aspects of this site which runs on the same platform as this website.</p>
<p>I am doing a similar project in my CSCE 490 and CSCE 492 Capstone project where we are building a Recipe and Pantry application where users can input the ingredients in their pantry, and they can find recipes that use those ingredients to reduce food waste and to achieve their health goals. For this project, I am the project manager, so I am responsible for reviewing the work of my four other group members. I take this project seriously as it is a graduation requirement for all of my peers as each of the two semesters of the capstone course is only offered once a year. Being a project manager also requires thinking about all the necessary aspects of the project, so you know where to start. Having someone be the SCRUM manager is important to ensure that sprints are divided efficiently and that tasks are not prerequisite tasks that need to be completed. My role is to constantly evaluate the performance of each task and the necessary manpower behind it and refine the requirements as implementation continues. Ensuring that prerequisite tasks are completed in a timely manager requires constant communication with each group member. In our project, we communicate to narrow down features that integrate together. For example, the recipes need the ingredients to be integrated, so understanding the progress of the ingredients module is critical to further development. The principles from my CSCE 247 class and internship at Publicis have been fundamental in my ability to complete my project and work better with others. These practices of team development allow for a project of any size to be narrowed down to allow groups and the strengths of individual group members to succeed.</p>

<p>Our Capstone sprint board for a given week. Every two weeks we create a layout with all the tasks that need to be completed. Each issue has an id, title, assignee, and status.</p>
<p>From these experiences, I have been able to grow as a developer while understanding better ways to work within groups. The pandemic has forced the world to be able to work remotely and I think the software development process is a great example of using practices to collaborate and one that works well virtually. With the internship lasting eight weeks, it was important to maximize the time we had to plan, develop, test, and present our project, these agile processes made it possible to plan that out. Having leadership experience in this field challenges me to learn more to hopefully become a tech lead at a big company. Collaboration gives me the ability to learn from and teach others which I think allows me to be a better developer but also a better person.</p>
