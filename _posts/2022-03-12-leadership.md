<h2>The Issue: How can we fill the gaps in the technology job market?</h2>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>With the growing role of complex technologies in daily life from transportation to the food we eat, there is a shortage in the number of people in the technology field to meet the demand for innovation. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that software developers have a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">job outlook increase of 22%</a> which is considered much faster than average. Other roles within Information Technology and software development also have higher than the national average growth, underscoring the critical need for young people to get involved with and study computer science. However, barriers such as engagement and education have impeded people from meeting the job market demand. The United States has long been the technology capital of the world, but without the skilled workforce to match countries the size of China, there is a need to invest in this issue. The University of South Carolina&rsquo;s College of Engineering and Computing has seen its retention rate increase for the first year but more needs to be done to help students stay in the programs. We also have to promote the enrollment of female and racial/ethnic minorities as they are underrepresented within the programs which I think can be done by providing more opportunities before and during college. I believe is important to increase alumni engagement and help more students get into internships or research.</p>

<h2>Importance of Issue</h2>
<p>This issue is significant because we all use technology every day to perform a wide range of tasks. Businesses everywhere use social media, apps for payment, and websites to manage their daily operations. Our society&rsquo;s technical progress is constrained by the ideas and those who would implement them. There&rsquo;s a need for more people to enter the field to think differently to come up with new solutions. This issue is so important that the Biden Administration has outlined ways of attracting students to the field, stating stem jobs&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-actions-to-attract-stem-talent-and-strengthen-our-economy-and-competitiveness/">&ldquo;are critical to the prosperity, security, and health of our Nation.&rdquo;</a></p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Increase the enrollment of students within STEM fields, especially computer science. Getting students more involved in supporting outreach programs such as the College of Engineering and Computing&rsquo;s Peer Mentorship program can also increase retention. There is a need to create a greater community of engineers to encourage prospective students to pursue the field. I want to encourage more people, especially those of different backgrounds, to pursue these fields, or at a minimum increase digital literacy. Helping students succeed through college and obtaining summer internships/co-ops and post-graduation jobs is critical to resolving our national technical labor shortage.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p><b>Participating in Mentoring</b><br>The College of Engineering and Computing offers mentorship programs from not only upperclassmen but also alumni. Upon graduating I want to continue mentoring students by giving UofSC students an insight into the importance of internships and what they should study. I personally struggled to find internships and I believe there is value in finding ways to market yourself better. My internship at Publicis Sapient helped me tremendously in becoming a better software engineer by giving me real-world experience with the concepts such as SCRUM agile development we learned in class. There is a need to ensure that students not only have the classroom experience but also have outside knowledge that will help them find what they would like to do with their lives. I especially want to encourage people from groups not typically represented in STEM to pursue the field. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Sharing STEM experiences</b><br>Through my insights and concepts learned in the classroom and my experiences outside of the classroom, I believe I am well positioned to give tips through a development project such as a blog. This website can gain traction through sharing it with friends with similar goals and students who I come across with my efforts. I want to create a website similar to the MIRC project and this portfolio website to share my experiences within the Computer Science field and political science. This website would contain information about getting started in the field, pathways through college, internship and research lessons, and pivoting from college to the workforce. Even if students cannot land a STEM-related job or experience, it is possible to work on a project similar to the MIRC project to solve a problem that is related to their interests or concepts from class. In fact, during the pandemic, I thought myself several technologies that were used in my capstone project and I was able to teach others from my group.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Getting involved with interns</b><br>Upon graduation, I want to work with interns to help them have a similar experience to what I had with Research Computing and Publicis Sapient. I want to get involved in alumni activities and form groups at work that seeks to provide support to students and interns or early career hires. Giving students meaningful feedback and training them for technologies that are not typically used within a classroom setting would help strengthen their technical skills and make them more employable upon graduation. I believe that more companies should invest in internship and early career programs as it gives students an opportunity and can lead to more equitable outcomes upon graduation. Many full-time roles require work experience that some students may not have or be able to afford, by providing these opportunities it is possible to bring more people of different backgrounds into the field. I value companies that have paid internship programs and are focused on training their potential graduates, which Publicis Sapient did.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Encouraging STEM students to study abroad</b><br>Through my interactions with students, I would encourage them to study abroad or pursue research abroad. Students within Computer Science disproportionately do not study abroad, often due to the lack of tailored programs and the difficulty of planning out their degrees. However, students can complete a cognate or a minor abroad and fulfill Carolina Core requirements by allocating those credits early on. I would encourage first-year students to plan accordingly to ensure they can study abroad and graduate on time. I was about to get my Computer Science and Political Science degrees with a Business Administration minor by ensuring I would get credit for my courses abroad and by taking summer courses to make up for upper-level classes that I could not take abroad. I would also encourage the College of Engineering and Computing and the registrarâ€™s office to streamline this process as it takes time and that can discourage students who think they will not graduate on time. I plan on doing this by getting involved in alumni groups that meet with college administrators.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>The evaluation of these goals can be reflected by the increase and retainment with an enrollment of students in university programs or coding boot camps. Efforts for diversity can be reflected in university and corporate diversity reports and by the equity outcomes of the work. While this roadmap is tailored toward what I can do to help solve this issue, if others participate in the process we can see greater meaningful change within STEM, specifically Computer Science. I want to get involved in employee groups that value these ideas and work with alumni of UofSC to do so. I believe that at the companies I work at in the future I can help support a new generation of software engineers. If a student I mentor is able to successfully obtain a job and internship, I believe it is worth it. On a larger scale, we can also see qualitative results by seeing more technological productivity as a society. At a minimum, I will be able to see more technical literacy in the people I engage with.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This issue of having a labor shortage in the technology field is one that is pressing and necessary to advance society. The many great feats of society have been made more efficient by technology and it has truly changed lives, but there is more to be done. My experiences studying abroad and working on software engineering projects have helped guide the future I want. Getting involved with employers such as the University of South Carolina, Atlas Air, and Publicis Sapient has motivated me to do better in my classes and I think more students should have that opportunity. Even if it is getting involved in research, promoting learning and thinking are skills that I value much more now. I believe that even people within the field should make an effort to help educate their peers and to create a greater sense of community. I want to encourage others to pursue the field and help those who are starting to find themselves. I also want to work with others from UofSC and my future colleagues to work toward this mission because I think it benefits us all.</p>
