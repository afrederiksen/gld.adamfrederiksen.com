<h2>The Issue: How can we fill the gaps in the technology job market?</h2>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
With the growing role of complex technologies in daily life from transportation to the food we eat, there is a shortage in the number of people in the technology field to meet the demand for innovation. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that software developers have a <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">job outlook increase of 22%</a> which is considered much faster than average. Other roles within Information Technology and software development also have higher than the national average growth, underscoring the critical need for young people to get involved with and to study computer science. However, barriers such as engagement and education have impeded people from meeting the job market demand. The United States has long been the technology capital of the world, but without the skilled workforce to match countries of the size of China, there is a need to invest in this issue. The University of South Carolina&rsquo;s College of Engineering and Computing has seen its retention rate increase for the first year but more needs to be done to help students stay in the programs.</p>

<h2>Importance of Issue</h2>
<p>This issue is significant because we all use technology every day to perform a wide range of tasks. Businesses everywhere use social media, apps for payment, and websites to manage their daily operations. Our technical progress is constrained by the ideas that those who are able to implement them, and those ideas need to think differently. This issue is so important that the Biden Administration has outlined ways of attracting students to the field, stating stem jobs <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-actions-to-attract-stem-talent-and-strengthen-our-economy-and-competitiveness/">&ldquo;are critical to the prosperity, security, and health of our Nation.&rdquo;</a></p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Increase the enrollment of students within STEM fields, especially computer science. It is important that these opportunities be afforded to everyone so ensuring that minorities are included is critical for building equitable technology outcomes. Getting students more involved in supporting outreach programs such as the College of Engineering and Computing&rsquo;s Peer Mentorship program. There is a need to create a greater community of engineers to encourage prospective students to pursue the field.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Promote Computer Science in K-12<br>Computer Science is still not a requirement in many schools around the nation. This is partially due to aging curriculums and the inability to find teachers for it. This can be done by utilizing resources such as code.org or khan academy which will supplement educators in the classroom.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Incentivize computer science programs<br>While the reward for completing a computer science program can land a well-paying job, the pathway there can be difficult as there are qualification requirements. Universities can help provide guaranteed internships and greater career center opportunities such as mock code interviews and job searching.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Supporting new students<br>Programs such as the Peer Mentorship Program have the ability to retain students over the years by giving them the advice and resources to succeed in this field. If the program does not make sense for the student, they will be more likely to drop it and go elsewhere. By supporting first-year programs which benefit students&rsquo; education, the retention rate can be improved.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Encourage and support a diversity of backgrounds and ideas<br>Collaboration plays a significant role in applications that are used by people globally who have different uses and beliefs. Diverse teams can offer features and use cases that might have not have been considered. Universities can help attract more diverse talent by creating talent pipelines with pre-college programs and scholarships. Encouraging students to look at other implementations of software from different regions of the world can inspire them to innovate. Computer Science students should try and study abroad to gain a greater perspective, meeting software engineers from other countries has taught me about their different practices. The university should try and encourage more College of Engineering students to study abroad.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Identifying key issues and adapting<br>Listening to students&apos; concerns about coding or information technology fields. Adapting the technical skills for different educational backgrounds. It is critical to keep modifying the curriculum to be up to date with what employers actually want from degrees.<br><br></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>The evaluation of these goals can be reflected by the increase in enrollment of students in university or coding boot camps. It is also important to keep retention data on students to monitor who is leaving the program and figure out why that is. Collecting feedback and assessments from students on whether they understand the material is important to help instructors better shape the programs. Efforts for diversity can be reflected in university and corporate diversity reports and by the equity outcomes of the work. We can also see the qualitative results by seeing more technological productivity as a society. At a minimum, the increased awareness of computer science principles, such as those K-12 programs, will better the technical competency of the general population.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This issue of having a labor shortage in the technology field is one that is pressing and necessary to advance society. The many great feats of society have been made more efficient by technology and it has truly changed lives, but there is more to be done. My experiences studying abroad and working on software engineering projects have helped guide the future I want. Getting involved with employers such as the University of South Carolina, Atlas Air, and Publicis Sapient has motivated me to do better in my classes and I think more students should have that opportunity. Even if it is getting involved in research, promoting learning and thinking are skills that I value much more now. I believe that even people within the field should make an effort to help educate their peers and to create a greater sense of community. I want to encourage others to pursue the field and help those who are starting to find themselves.&nbsp;</p>
