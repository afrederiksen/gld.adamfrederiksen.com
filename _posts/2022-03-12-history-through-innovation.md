<p>When joining a software engineering project, it is important to familiarize yourself with the background of what is being created and to understand the purpose of its use. During my senior year, I worked on a video streaming project for the University of South Carolina Libraries&rsquo; Moving Image Research Collection (MIRC) where I inherited a platform that had to be tailored for a Marine Corps film exhibition. Software engineering is a combination of understanding the issue that needs to be resolved and then choosing the right tools for the job. My dual degree in Computer Science and Political Science is a unique mix because one is a technical major and the other is a social science. However, these two skill sets come in handy when creating useful features and finding value in what I am creating. In my coursework in political science, we use researchers&rsquo; data to understand trends and whether an issue can be explained. Working on this project helped me see firsthand what these research platforms can look like and I am excited to see what researchers are able to do with the data. In a world that has been criticized as being too technically focused and lacking humanity in those technologies, I think it is important to understand global trends and to make those connections.</p>
<p>In my POLI 341 Contemporary United States Foreign Policy course, we discussed data-based issues such as migration, military intervention, US aid, and trade. The course emphasized the concept of using data to identify trends that could answer larger questions regarding current foreign policy issues. This concept of using data and knowledge pools to answer research questions and then sharing those findings is critical as studies within the class are built on top of each other. Within these issues, we looked at studies that gave us trends such as the United States&rsquo; tendency to care more about countries that are closer to the homeland such as those in South and Central America. We studied the costs of foreign intervention and how the United States believes it has an obligation to prevent genocide by diplomatic or military assistance. The course was study-based so we would look at various findings from researchers within the foreign policy field, giving us a wide range of modern-day understandings of US diplomacy. In the process, we also looked back at where the US failed or succeeded in the past and how those lessons are reflected in today&rsquo;s foreign policy toolbox. Each week in the course we were asked to post discussion questions that were related to the topics we were discussing and then we would have to try to answer our own questions. We would then review some of the questions and find studies that would help to answer those questions. This challenged me to connect the concepts learned in class to current day issues such as US competition with the Chinese Belt and Road initiative that has led African countries into debt traps in exchange for influence. We understood this by looking at how the US has previously used financial aid to countries that are closer to us such as Latin America, rather than those in Africa, leaving a gap for other countries to gain influence. By asking these questions my ability to connect issues and the suggestive trends behind them was greatly enriched.</p>

<p>An example of a weekly discussion question we would pose in class. This one is related to foreign aid and the donor of the benefit nations obtain. We would read published journal articles on topics, considering the data and the resulting inferences, and then wrote a question related to what we read. We would then have to try and answer it by using the concepts from the course and the course materials.</p>
<p>By better understanding, the United State&rsquo;s foreign policy it helped supplement my work when developing features for the MIRC platform. My job as a student researcher was to build out a streaming platform using Amazon Web Services for the web platform, similar to Netflix. This platform is intended to replace the current video-on-demand system which is not as cost-efficient as it does not use the streamable m3u8 format that chops up the video segments, so you do not have to waste bandwidth on the entire video. Using the data that the videos had I was also able to make the search functionality relevant to filtering by decade or keywords. I found the project interesting as I was working with new technologies to create a repository for video content that is made available to researchers who want to explore US Marine Corps history. The project was an example of the social sciences coming together with technology to make content that was originally on film to be online. This archival footage could be then used by researchers for data collection to find trends and answer questions like those discussed in my US Foreign Policy course. This platform can be used for other collections too by adapting to the metadata to help answer other questions as well.</p>

<p>A screenshot of the streaming interface playing a video about Operation Strongback, an aviation demonstration event from September 1958. This is an example of content that researchers can use to extract data such as faces, which researchers are currently trying to do to try and track specific soldiers to figure out their movements throughout conflicts. This connects to the idea of using technology and data to solve a difficult research question, which can benefit our overall understanding. Similar to how we looked at trends regarding US foreign aid and interventions throughout history, we can always add knowledge.</p>
<p>My foreign policy course taught me about how researchers use trends to help explain historical, present, and future events when applying policies through data. The MIRC project gave me an opportunity to immerse myself in US military history and think back to some of the topics in my foreign policy course such as foreign interventions and where the US has strategic interests. As seen in that Operation Strongback video, my efforts to work on this system connect to the desire to learn more about our history and provide background around it. I think understanding the world around me will help me navigate the ever-changing global landscape by innovating how we view history. I learned how historical trends and the wide context they can provide can help supplement research that is then taught in my political science courses. My Computer Science and Political Science combination is a result of my interest in solving greater problems in society by understanding institutions and their historical actions which can provide insight into the present day. My hope is that my contributions to this project can be used by researchers to give greater insight into our history and US foreign policy decisions, much like those concepts in my course.</p>
